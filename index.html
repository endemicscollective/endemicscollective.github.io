              <p>The Endemics is an ensemble initially formed online during the pandemic, consisting of four live coders
                based in Tkaronto/Toronto.</p>

              <p><a href="https://www.ka-vi.com/" target="_blank">Ilze Briede</a> [Kavi] is a
                Latvian/Canadian artist working across multiple disciplines, including visual art, interactive
                installation and live performance. Kavi live codes visuals with Hydra+TouchDesigner and is most
                fascinated by feedback loops.</p>

              <p><a href="https://magfoto.xyz/now" target="_blank">magfoto</a> (Marcus Gordon) is a live coder, artist,
                and PhD candidate in Computational Arts at York University. His practice explores live coding
                archimusic, composition and improvisation with modular synthesis.</p>

                A Quad Entropic Conversation is a live coding performance by ensemble The Endemics, that features speech
                used in various forms to carry on an audiovisual conversation between the four members and their
                instruments. Live coded in Hydra, Orca, and SuperCollider, and ending with a touch of analog modular
                sound, a conversation unravels inside a wormhole. The meaning of the words, the meanings in speech, and
                everything transmitted in the form of communication, undergoes a transformation, due to the entropic
                forces taking place in black holes. Knowing from the beginning that parts and pieces of ourselves get
                lost, and displaced in our exchanges with others, we find an opportunity to better tackle the resistance
                emerging in our conversations and create open ended dialogues with one another and through the code we
                share. <a href="https://vimeo.com/781676262" target="_blank">Link</a>
